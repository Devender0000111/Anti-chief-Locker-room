# Anti-chief-Locker-room
Project is for an anti-theft locker room system designed using the 8051
microcontroller. In this project, there is a room in which three keypads are
there to access the lockers. Only three people can be in the room at one time,
and once the room is full an LED is lit and a “ROOM FULL” message is shown.
Afterwards, the users can enter their keys to access the locker. If the user
enters the correct key, the way to locker is opened and an LED is lit to show
this.If the user enters the wrong key, they are given two more attempts to
enter the right key. If the user runs out of attempts, an alarm buzzer is
activated and the message “ALARM!” is displayed, and the door to the room
will be locked.
